## To use

Add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```tut:silent:fail
libraryDependencies += "com.github.zainab-ali" %% "fs2-reactive-streams" % "0.8.0"
```
This is dependent on version `1.0.0-M5` of fs2.

## TL;DR


```tut:book
import cats._, cats.effect._, fs2._
import fs2.interop.reactivestreams._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

implicit val contextShift: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)

val upstream = Stream(1, 2, 3).covary[IO]
val publisher = upstream.toUnicastPublisher
val downstream = publisher.toStream[IO]
downstream.compile.toVector.unsafeRunSync()
```

## Why?

The [reactive streams initiative](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) is complicated, mutable and unsafe - it is not something that is desired for use over fs2.
But there are times when we need use fs2 in conjunction with a different streaming library, and this is where reactive streams shines.

Any reactive streams system can interop with any other reactive streams system by exposing an `org.reactivestreams.Publisher` or an `org.reactivestreams.Subscriber`.

This library provides instances of reactivestreams compliant publishers and subscribers to ease interop with other streaming libraries.

## Usage

You may require the following imports

```tut:silent:reset
import cats._, cats.effect._, fs2._
import fs2.interop.reactivestreams._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext
```

A `ContextShift` instance is necessary when working with `IO`

```tut:silent
implicit val contextShift: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)
```

To convert a `Stream` into a downstream unicast `org.reactivestreams.Publisher`:

```tut:silent
val stream = Stream(1, 2, 3).covary[IO]
stream.toUnicastPublisher
```

To convert an upstream `org.reactivestreams.Publisher` into a `Stream`:

```tut:silent
val publisher: org.reactivestreams.Publisher[Int] = Stream(1, 2, 3).covary[IO].toUnicastPublisher
publisher.toStream[IO]
```

A unicast publisher must have a single subscriber only.

## Example: Akka streams to Stream[IO]

Import the Akka streams dsl:

```tut:silent:reset
import akka._
import akka.stream._
import akka.stream.scaladsl._
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import cats.effect._
import fs2.Stream
import fs2.interop.reactivestreams._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

implicit val system: ActorSystem = ActorSystem("akka-streams-example")
implicit val materializer: ActorMaterializer = ActorMaterializer()

implicit val contextShift: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)
```

To convert from a `Source` to a `Stream`:

```tut:book
val source = Source(1 to 5)
val publisher = source.runWith(Sink.asPublisher[Int](fanout = false))
val stream = publisher.toStream[IO]
stream.compile.toVector.unsafeRunSync()
```

To convert from a `Stream` to a `Source`:

```tut:book
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global

val stream = Stream.emits((1 to 5).toSeq).covary[IO]
val source = Source.fromPublisher(stream.toUnicastPublisher)
IO.fromFuture(IO(source.runWith(Sink.seq[Int]))).unsafeRunSync()
```
```tut:invisible
system.terminate()
```

## Version Compatability

Patch releases (e.g `0.2.7` to `0.2.8`) are binary compatible.  If you're concerned about a broken release, please check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

## Credits

Many thanks go to [Ross Baker](https://github.com/rossabaker) who took the first step in making a reactive streams implementation in [http4s](https://github.com/http4s/http4s).  Without this, fs2-reactive-streams would have been much harder to write.
